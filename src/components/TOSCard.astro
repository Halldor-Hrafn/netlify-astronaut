    <h1><span>Terms of Service - The Fog Is Coming</span></h1>
    <p>
      Greetings, weary traveler of the digital realm, and welcome to "The Fog Is
      Coming" website (hereinafter referred to as "the Website"). As you embark
      on this mysterious journey into the enigmatic mist, please take a moment
      to acquaint yourself with our delightfully tongue-in-cheek Terms of
      Service (ToS). By proceeding, you're agreeing to these terms that are
      about as serious as a clown at a library.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>1. Arrival into the Mists</h2>
    <p>
      By entering "The Fog Is Coming," you acknowledge that you are venturing
      into an online realm as mysterious as the Bermuda Triangle but with more
      cat videos. Any attempts to navigate logic or find profound meaning shall
      be met with the sound of a distant kazoo.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>2. Mystical Copyright Conundrum</h2>
    <p>
      All content found within the fog, including but not limited to perplexing
      articles, puzzling images, and befuddling videos, are subject to our
      nebulous copyright laws. Unauthorized duplication, alteration, or attempts
      at decryption will result in the transformation of your keyboard into a
      rubber chicken.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>3. Cryptic Contributions</h2>
    <p>
      Should you choose to contribute to the fog, you grant us the arcane right
      to use, remix, and remix-remix your submissions into a digital potion of
      indescribable taste. By contributing, you confirm that your creations are
      divinely inspired by the muse of absurdity.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>4. Shadows of Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Your presence in the fog gives us the eerily vague permission to collect
      your digital shadow's footprints. We may use cookies, runes, and the
      occasional tarot card to predict your browsing path, but we solemnly
      promise not to peep into your dreams or your browser history.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>5. Curses and Liability</h2>
    <p>
      In your pursuit of foggy enlightenment, you agree to keep "The Fog Is
      Coming" unharmed by any claims, spectral apparitions, or existential
      conundrums that may arise from your visit. This includes but is not
      limited to sudden urges to write haikus about bureaucracy.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>6. The Prophecy of Entertainment</h2>
    <p>
      We disclaim any obligation, prediction, or cosmic foresight regarding the
      level of amusement, confusion, or enlightenment you may obtain from the
      fog. Any sudden bursts of laughter or forehead-slapping realizations are
      purely coincidental and should be interpreted as a gift from the cosmic
      giggle committee.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>7. Dispersal of the Mist</h2>
    <p>
      We retain the otherworldly right to dissolve your connection to the fog at
      any time, whether due to a mischievous wizard's spell or a cosmic yawn. If
      this termination incites feelings of elation, you pledge to write an ode
      to paradoxes in reverse rhyming pentameter.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>8. Governing Laws of the Nebula</h2>
    <p>
      This ToS is subject to the whims of the cosmic alignment. Disputes shall
      be settled through a metaphysical debate between Schr√∂dinger's cat and a
      talking toaster, with the audience being a parliament of wise owls.
    </p>
    <p>
      In conclusion, your presence within "The Fog Is Coming" indicates your
      acknowledgment and acceptance of these mystical, not-quite-serious Terms
      of Service. If these terms fail to align with your cosmic coordinates, you
      are encouraged to seek alternative realms beyond the fog's reach.
