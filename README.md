# Rough overview of how I *ideally* want the workflow to be

Make some new developments to the site, any new developments to the site are to be put in the dev branch. Once those changes have been *mostly* completed, it is then ready to be pushed to the main branch, to the main website. Merges are only to be made once the relevant pages have both an English and Icelandic translation.

I really hope that I would be able to follow my own rules... but I make no promises.
